# FiiSoft Dbase

Package with few classes to read dbase (*.dbf) files.
It requires dbase module enabled in PHP.

To have code-completion with dbase-functions in your IDE you can use file stubs/dbase_functions.php

My advice is - do not use it unless you are enough strong mentally to immune for such bad code. 

#### `DbaseReader`

The main class in package. Use it to open and read dbase file. All other classes are auxiliary.
